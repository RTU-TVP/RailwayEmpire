## Game Description

The game is a railway station management simulator where the player takes on the role of a station manager. The player's
tasks include station management, infrastructure improvement, employee supervision, and unloading arriving trains for
cargo resale.

The game draws inspiration from "The Battle of Polytopia" and adopts its "Low Poly" visual style, camera placement, and
user-friendly gameplay simplicity.

The player's goal is to make the station successful and prosperous, with a primary focus on unloading trains. To achieve
this, gameplay involves mini-games corresponding to different types of train cars.
